A open-source, 386BSD based BSD distribution aimed for a unique PC operating system experience.

BNU-BSD is a operating system based on 386BSD. BNU-BSD stands for "BasinOS is not UNIX BSD". BNU-BSD aims to be an os that is not bloated or packed with useless features similar to how Windows is but BNU-BSD aims to be a operating system that can run on hardware as old as the 2000s! It doesn't need TPM or any crappy user interface, But rather will have a simple yet unique interface that can run on old hardware. 386-BSD is reliable and secure. Being based on BSD, It is a COMPLETE operating system with its own libraries and drivers and etc. BNU-BSD is built upon the solid foundation of BSD that is reliable and trustworthy. BNU-BSD aims to be "easy peasy, lemon squeezy!". 

BNU-BSD is for everyone! Beginners, Advanced users, etc.

BNU-BSD is currently in development and is currently a work in progress. It was forked from 386BSD.
