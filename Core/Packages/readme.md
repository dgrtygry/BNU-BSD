This is where packages go that are preincluded with BNU-BSD

NOTE: These are compiled and may contain code from other repos.

Credits to the devs of these packages. I just ported them to BNU-BSD.

HOW TO INSTALL:

rename ".bpkg" to ".zip"

unzip {packagename.zip}

cd {packagename.zip}

sudo sh {packagename.sh}

it will install the package.
